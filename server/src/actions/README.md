# Actions

Owns the command execution boundary and persisted idempotency outcomes for CRM activities.

## Implementation

- [actions.model.ts](actions.model.ts): The `action_requests` table, including requester-scoped keys and stored results.
- [actions.repository.ts](actions.repository.ts): Request lookup, action lookup, and result persistence.
- [actions.service.ts](actions.service.ts): Actor verification, request fingerprints, version checks, dispatch to domain services, aggregate versions, and commit coordination.
- [actions.controller.ts](actions.controller.ts): Validation and authenticated handling of `POST /api/crm/actions`.

## Coordination

Execution uses an immediate SQLite transaction with a nested savepoint. A rejected operation rolls back business writes while its request outcome can still be stored. Applied activities advance the customer and all of its order versions, append an event, and pass Audit checks before commit. Domain services own the actual order, fulfillment, finance, and reward operations. Browser clients, CLI seeding, and integration fixtures submit commands through this boundary.
